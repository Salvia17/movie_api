    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>To build the server­side component of a “movies” web application.
      The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users
      will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
      movies.</p>

            Description: Crime films, in the broadest sense, is a film genre
            inspired by and analogous to the crime fiction literary genre.
            Films of this genre generally involve various aspects of crime
            and its detection. Stylistically, the genre may overlap and
            combine with many other genres, such as drama or gangster film,
            but also include comedy, and, in turn, is divided into many sub-genres,
            such as mystery, suspense or noir.</td>

            producer, and actor. His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines,
            dark humor, aestheticization of violence, extended scenes of dialogue,
            ensemble casts, references to popular culture and a wide variety of other
            films, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the
            1960s to the 1980s, alternate history, and features of neo-noir film.</td>
